User: "show me bags with images"
Atlas: Understands user wants bags AND wants to see images
// Not searching for "bags images"

// Example 2: Complex ambiguity resolution âœ…  
User: "Corporate gifts under $20"
Atlas: "I'd like to clarify - is that $20 per gift or $20 total budget? 
        And who are these gifts for - clients, employees, or prospects?"

// Example 3: Industry context intelligence âœ…
User: "Premium quality polo shirts for our tech startup"  
Atlas: Interprets "premium" in tech industry context
// Recommends high-tech, modern, sleek designs at medium-high budget
```
