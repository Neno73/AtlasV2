# Atlas Promotional Products AI Assistant - Technical Documentation

## Overview

Atlas is a sophisticated conversational AI assistant designed specifically for promotional products dealers. Built with Google Genkit, it provides superior semantic understanding and multi-turn conversation capabilities that significantly outperform traditional keyword-based systems.

## Core Problem Solved

**Challenge**: Traditional systems fail at semantic understanding. For example, "show me bags with images" searches for "bags images" instead of understanding the user wants bags AND wants to see images.

**Solution**: Atlas separates product entities from display preferences and actions through advanced intent analysis and context understanding.

## System Architecture

### 8 Major Components

#### 1. Multi-Layered Intent Analysis System (`src/intent-analyzer.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Classifies user intentions and extracts product requirements
- **Capabilities**:
  - Intent classification (product_search, specification_inquiry, budget_discussion, etc.)
  - Product entity extraction
  - Confidence scoring
  - Multi-step analysis pipeline

#### 2. Context Extraction Framework (`src/context-intelligence.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Understands business context and industry patterns
- **Capabilities**:
  - Industry detection (technology, healthcare, finance, education, etc.)
  - Event type classification (trade_show, conference, employee_onboarding, etc.)
  - Recipient analysis (employees, clients, prospects, event_attendees)
  - Context-aware recommendations

#### 3. Ambiguity Detection Engine (`src/ambiguity-detector.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Identifies and prioritizes potential misunderstandings
- **Capabilities**:
  - 7 types of ambiguity detection:
    - Product category ambiguity
    - Quantity scope confusion
    - Budget interpretation issues
    - Timeline urgency unclear
    - Quality expectation ambiguity
    - Customization extent unclear
    - Recipient specification vague
  - Confidence scoring and impact assessment
  - Smart clarification question generation

#### 4. Business Intelligence System (`src/context-intelligence.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides strategic recommendations and industry insights
- **Capabilities**:
  - Industry-specific quality expectations
  - Budget range guidance
  - Product category recommendations
  - Strategic business insights

#### 5. Conversation Management (`src/conversation-manager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles conversation state and flow management
- **Capabilities**:
  - State transition management
  - Conversation health monitoring
  - Progress assessment
  - Stuck conversation detection

#### 6. Proactive Clarification System (`src/ambiguity-detector.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Generates intelligent clarifying questions
- **Capabilities**:
  - Priority-based question generation
  - Multiple question types (open-ended, multiple choice, yes/no, range)
  - Industry-appropriate terminology
  - Context-aware questioning

#### 7. Learning & Adaptation System (`src/conversation-manager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Improves system performance through conversation analysis
- **Capabilities**:
  - User preference learning
  - Conversation pattern analysis
  - System improvement identification
  - Performance metrics tracking

#### 8. Comprehensive Schema System (`src/schemas.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Defines all data structures and types
- **Capabilities**:
  - Type-safe data handling
  - Comprehensive conversation context
  - Extensible schema design

### Main Conversation Flows (`src/flows.ts`)

#### Primary Flows
1. **conversationFlow**: Main entry point for user interactions
2. **requirementsGatheringFlow**: Handles multi-turn clarification
3. **productDiscoveryFlow**: Legacy compatibility flow

## Key Features

### Semantic Understanding
- Separates product types from display preferences
- Understands context-dependent meanings
- Handles industry-specific terminology
- Processes ambiguous queries intelligently

### Industry Intelligence
```typescript
// Example: Technology industry context
{
  qualityExpectations: 'high-tech, modern, sleek designs',
  budgetRange: 'medium to high',
  preferredProducts: ['tech accessories', 'branded apparel', 'desk items'],
  commonUses: ['employee onboarding', 'conference swag', 'client gifts']
}
```

### Ambiguity Detection Patterns
```typescript
// Example: Budget interpretation ambiguity
{
  type: 'budget_interpretation',
  description: 'User said "under $20" but unclear if per item or total budget',
  possibleInterpretations: ['$20 per item', '$20 total budget'],
  confidence: 0.8,
  impact: 'high'
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Display Preference Separation ✅
```
User: "show me bags with images"
System Understanding:
- Product Type: "bags"
- Display Preference: "with images"
- Action: Show product recommendations with visual displays
```

### Example 2: Complex Ambiguity Resolution ✅
```
User: "Corporate gifts under $20"
System Response: 
"I'd like to clarify a few details to find the perfect gifts:
1. Is that $20 per gift or $20 total budget?
2. Who are these gifts for - clients, employees, or prospects?
3. What industry is your company in?"
```

### Example 3: Context-Aware Interpretation ✅
```
User: "Premium quality polo shirts for our tech startup"
System Understanding:
- Industry Context: Technology (startup culture)
- Quality Expectation: High-tech, modern, sleek designs
- Product: Polo shirts with tech industry appeal
- Budget Range: Medium to high (typical for tech companies)
```

## Test Scenarios (`src/test-examples.ts`)

The system includes comprehensive test scenarios covering:
- Display preference separation
- Ambiguous product categories
- Budget scope confusion
- Quality expectation ambiguity
- Multi-layer ambiguity detection
- Industry-specific interpretation
- Event context detection
- Assumption validation
- Complex specification requirements
